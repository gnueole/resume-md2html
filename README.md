## 📁 Project File Structure

- `server.py`: Ultra‑lightweight local server written in Python (no dependencies to install). It serves the application and saves your data to disk.
- `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`: Source code for the editing UI, auto‑zoom system, and ATS analyzer.
- `templates.css`: Rendering styles for A4 page (screen + PDF print rules).
- `sample.md`: Default resume template (example author) provided as a starting point.
- `resume.md`: **[Generated]** Your Markdown resume content.
- `config.json`: **[Generated]** Your custom layout settings (chosen fonts, sizes, line spacing, colors).

*Note: Committing and pushing `resume.md` and `config.json` to Git lets you synchronize all your text and style changes across machines.*

## 📝 Specific Resume Directives (Guide)

Following standard guidelines, you can use special shortcuts in your Markdown to style the output:

- **Accent Color**: Use `:accent[your text]` to color important elements (e.g., `:accent[Immediately available]`).
- **Muted Text (gray)**: Use `:muted[your text]` to visually de‑emphasize secondary information while keeping it indexable by ATS bots (e.g., `:muted[Driver's license B · Own vehicle]`).
- **Contact Bar**: The editor automatically detects the line containing your emails or links and formats it neatly. You can also force a centered contact block with the syntax `[CONTACT : email | phone | linkedin]`.
